# Parallel Execution

Ralph TUI can execute independent tasks in parallel, using **git worktrees** to isolate each worker's changes. When tasks have no mutual dependencies, they run simultaneously — then merge back to your main branch sequentially.

<Callout type="tip">
  Parallel execution activates automatically when ralph-tui detects independent tasks. No configuration required for the default behavior.
</Callout>

## Why Parallel?

In a typical project, many tasks are independent. A login page fix doesn't depend on a dashboard refactor. Running them one at a time wastes time waiting for agents to finish sequentially.

With parallel execution:

- **Independent tasks run simultaneously** across multiple workers
- **Each worker gets its own git worktree** — full isolation, no conflicts during execution
- **Results merge sequentially** with automatic conflict detection
- **AI-assisted conflict resolution** handles merge conflicts when they arise
- **Rollback safety** via backup tags before every merge

## Quick Start

```bash
# Auto-detect parallelism (default behavior)
ralph-tui run

# Force parallel execution with 4 workers
ralph-tui run --parallel 4

# Force sequential execution (disable parallel)
ralph-tui run --serial
```

When ralph-tui starts, it analyzes your task dependencies and determines whether parallel execution is beneficial. If it finds groups of independent tasks, it automatically switches to parallel mode.

## How It Decides

The auto-detection heuristic checks three conditions:

1. **At least one parallel group** has 2+ tasks that can run simultaneously
2. **At least 3 total tasks** (overhead isn't worth it for just 2)
3. **Less than 50% cyclic dependencies** (heavily coupled tasks don't parallelize well)

If all conditions are met, parallel mode activates. Otherwise, ralph-tui falls back to sequential execution.

## What Happens

```
                    ┌─── Worker 1 (worktree) ──→ merge ─┐
Task Graph ───→     ├─── Worker 2 (worktree) ──→ merge ─┤──→ Main Branch
Analysis            └─── Worker 3 (worktree) ──→ merge ─┘
```

1. **Analyze** — Build a dependency graph and group tasks by depth level
2. **Execute** — Each group runs its tasks in parallel across isolated worktrees
3. **Merge** — Completed workers merge back to main one at a time
4. **Resolve** — Conflicts get AI-assisted resolution or safe rollback
5. **Repeat** — Next group starts after the previous group's merges complete
