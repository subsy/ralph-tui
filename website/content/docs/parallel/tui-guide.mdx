# TUI Guide

When parallel execution is active, ralph-tui adds new views and keyboard shortcuts for monitoring workers, merges, and conflicts.

## Workers View

Press `w` to toggle the parallel workers view. This shows all active workers with their status, progress, and task titles:

```
◆ Workers (3) Group 1/2
▶ W1 [3/10] feat: Add login page          2m 15s
✓ W2 [10/10] fix: Auth validation bug      1m 42s
⏵ W3 [7/10] feat: Dashboard widgets       1m 58s
─── Merge Queue ───
⟳ W2 → main  merging...
⋯ W1 → main  queued
```

### Status Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `▶` | Running | Green |
| `✓` | Completed | Green |
| `✗` | Failed | Red |
| `■` | Cancelled | Gray |
| `○` | Idle | Dim |

### Merge Queue Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `⟳` | Merging in progress | Blue |
| `⋯` | Queued for merge | Gray |
| `✓` | Successfully merged | Green |
| `⚡` | Conflict detected | Yellow |
| `✗` | Merge failed | Red |
| `↩` | Rolled back | Yellow |

## Worker Detail View

From the workers view, use `↑`/`↓` to select a worker, then press `Enter` to drill into its detail view:

```
◆ Worker W1 ▶ Running 2m 15s
Task: task-123 — feat: Add login page
Iteration 3/10
────────────────────────────────────────────
Creating login form component...
Adding email validation...
Writing test for LoginForm...
```

The detail view shows:
- Worker header with status and elapsed time
- Task ID and title
- Current iteration progress
- Live agent output stream (scrolled to latest)

Press `Esc` to return to the workers overview.

## Merge Progress View

Press `m` to toggle the merge progress view. This shows the complete merge queue with detailed status:

```
⟳ Merge Queue (2/5 merged)
Backup: ralph/session-start/abc123
────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ task-101 → main  Merged             12s
  fix: Auth validation bug
⟳ task-102 → main  Merging...          3s
  feat: Add login page
⋯ task-103 → main  Queued
  feat: Dashboard widgets
```

Each entry shows:
- Merge status indicator and label
- Task ID and branch name
- Elapsed time (for active/completed merges)
- Task title
- Conflict count (if applicable)

## Conflict Resolution Panel

When a merge conflict is detected, a modal overlay appears:

```
┌─── ⚡ Merge Conflict Resolution ────────────┐
│ Task: task-102 — feat: Add login page        │
│ Files: 3 conflicted, 1 resolved              │
│ ⟳ AI conflict resolution in progress...      │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────────── │
│ ▸ ✓ src/auth/login.ts        Resolved (ai)   │
│   ⚡ src/components/Form.tsx  Unresolved       │
│   ⚡ src/styles/auth.css      Unresolved       │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────────── │
│ a Accept  r Reject  A Accept All  Esc Abort  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Conflict Panel Keys

| `a` | Accept resolution for selected file |
