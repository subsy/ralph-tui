## Beads Tracker

The Beads tracker integrates with [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), a git-backed issue tracker. Issues are stored as JSONL in your repo and sync across team members via git.

<Callout type="tip">
Beads is ideal for team projects - everyone sees the same issues, and changes are tracked in git history.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Install the Beads CLI from the **[Beads GitHub repo](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)**.

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
cd your-project
bd init
```

This creates a `.beads/` directory with your issue tracker.

## Basic Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Epic">
    Epics group related tasks:

    ```bash
    bd create --title "User Authentication" --type epic
    # Created: beads-abc123
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tasks as Children of the Epic">
    Tasks must be **children** of the epic (using `--parent`) to appear when running with `--epic`:

    ```bash
    bd create --title "Login form" --type task --parent beads-abc123
    bd create --title "Auth API" --type task --parent beads-abc123
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
    The `--parent` flag creates a parent-child relationship. Without it, tasks won't appear when filtering by epic.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dependencies (Optional)">
    If tasks depend on each other, add dependencies so Ralph works on them in the right order:

    ```bash
    # Login form depends on Auth API being done first
    bd dep add beads-login beads-api
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ralph TUI">
    Run with the epic ID:

    ```bash
    ralph-tui run --tracker beads --epic beads-abc123
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

Run with epic and tracker:

```bash
ralph-tui run --tracker beads --epic beads-abc123
```

### Config File

Set defaults in TOML:

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml
tracker = "beads"

[trackerOptions]
beadsDir = ".beads"
# labels = "frontend,backend"  # Optional: filter by labels
```

### Options Reference

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `beadsDir` | string | `.beads` | Path to .beads directory |
| `epicId` | string | - | Epic ID to filter tasks (set via `--epic` flag) |
| `labels` | string | (empty) | Optional comma-separated label filter |
| `workingDir` | string | `.` | Working directory for bd commands |

<Callout type="info">
The `epicId` should be set via `--epic` flag rather than config, since you'll likely work on different epics.
</Callout>

## Beads Concepts

### Epics

Epics are top-level containers for related work:

```bash
# Create an epic
bd create --title "Feature: Dark Mode" --type epic

# List epics
bd list --type epic
```

### Tasks

Tasks are individual work items, optionally under an epic:

```bash
# Create standalone task
bd create --title "Fix login bug" --type task

# Create task under epic
bd create --title "Add toggle switch" --type task --parent beads-xyz
```

### Dependencies

Tasks can depend on (be blocked by) other tasks:

```bash
# Add dependency: task-b depends on task-a
bd dep add beads-task-b beads-task-a

# View dependencies
bd show beads-task-b
```

### Statuses

| Beads Status | Ralph TUI Status | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `open` | `open` | Ready to work |
| `in_progress` | `in_progress` | Currently being worked on |
| `closed` | `completed` | Finished |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` | Won't do |

### Priorities

Beads uses 0-4 priority scale (0 = critical):

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 0 | Critical |
| 1 | High |
| 2 | Medium (default) |
| 3 | Low |
| 4 | Backlog |

## Task Selection

The Beads tracker selects the next task by:

1. Filter to tasks under the specified epic
2. Filter to tasks with status `open`
3. Filter to tasks with no unresolved dependencies
4. Sort by priority (lowest number first)
5. Return the first matching task

## Git Sync

Beads stores issues in `.beads/beads.jsonl`. Sync with your team:

```bash
# Export tracker state to JSONL (safe, no git side effects)
bd sync --flush-only

# Then commit and push manually
git add .beads/ && git commit -m "Update beads" && git push
```

Ralph TUI calls `bd sync --flush-only` automatically when you run, which exports tracker state to JSONL without performing any git operations. This prevents data loss on branches that haven't been pushed to a remote.

## Label Filtering (Optional)

You can optionally filter issues by labels to separate different types of work in the same beads repo.

### Adding Labels to Issues

```bash
# Add label when creating
bd create --title "My task" --type task --label frontend

# Add label to existing issue
bd label add beads-xyz backend
```

### Configuring the Label Filter

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml
[trackerOptions]
labels = "frontend,backend"  # Only show issues with these labels
# labels = ""                # Empty (default) = show all issues
```

<Callout type="info">
By default, no label filter is applied - all issues are visible. Configure labels if you want to filter.
</Callout>

## How It Works

When Ralph TUI runs with the Beads tracker:

1. **Detect**: Check for `.beads/` directory and `bd` CLI
2. **Query**: Run `bd list --json --parent <epic>` to get tasks
3. **Select**: Find next task (ready, highest priority)
4. **Update**: Set task to `in_progress` via `bd update`
5. **Execute**: Run agent with task prompt
6. **Complete**: Set task to `closed` via `bd update`
7. **Sync**: Run `bd sync --flush-only` to export state to JSONL

### bd Commands Used

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| List tasks | `bd list --json --parent <epic>` |
| Get task | `bd show <id> --json` |
| Start task | `bd update <id> --status in_progress` |
| Complete task | `bd update <id> --status closed` |
| Sync | `bd sync --flush-only` |

## Switching Epics

Change epics mid-session by pressing `l` in the TUI:

1. Press `l` to open epic selector
2. Choose from available epics
3. Task list updates to show new epic's tasks

Or restart with a different `--epic` flag.

## Troubleshooting

### "Beads directory not found"

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
bd init
```

### "bd binary not available"

Install the Beads CLI from the **[Beads GitHub repo](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)**.

### "No tasks available"

Check that:
1. **Tasks are children of the epic**: `bd list --parent <epic>` (create with `--parent <epic>`)
2. **Tasks are `open` status**: `bd list --status open`
3. **Dependencies are met**: `bd show <task-id>` (blocked tasks won't be selected)
4. **Label filter matches** (if configured): `bd list --label <your-label>`

### "Tasks not syncing"

Run sync manually:

```bash
bd sync --flush-only
git add .beads/ && git commit -m "Sync beads"
```

Check for git conflicts in `.beads/beads.jsonl`.

## Creating Tasks from PRDs

Convert a PRD to Beads issues:

```bash
# Create PRD
ralph-tui create-prd --chat

# When prompted, choose "Beads" format
# Or convert manually:
ralph-tui convert --to beads ./tasks/my-prd.md
```

## Beads vs JSON Tracker

| Feature | JSON | Beads |
|---------|------|-------|
| Setup complexity | Lowest | Medium |
| External tools | None | `bd` CLI |
| Git sync | Manual | Automatic |
| Epic hierarchy | No | Yes |
| Team collaboration | Limited | Full |
| Offline support | Full | Full |

Choose JSON for quick experiments, Beads for team projects.
