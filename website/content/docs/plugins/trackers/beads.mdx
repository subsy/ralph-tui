## Beads Tracker

The Beads tracker integrates with [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), a git-backed issue tracker. Issues are stored as JSONL in your repo and sync across team members via git.

<Callout type="tip">
  Beads is ideal for team projects - everyone sees the same issues, and changes
  are tracked in git history.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Install the Beads CLI from the **[Beads GitHub repo](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)**.

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
cd your-project
bd init
```

This creates a `.beads/` directory with your issue tracker.

## Basic Usage

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** By default, Ralph TUI only shows issues with the `ralph` label.
  Either add this label to your issues, or change the label filter during setup
  (leave blank to see all issues).
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Epic">
    Epics group related tasks. Add the `ralph` label so Ralph TUI can see it:

    ```bash
    bd create --title "User Authentication" --type epic --label ralph
    # Created: beads-abc123
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tasks as Children of the Epic">
    Tasks must be **children** of the epic (using `--parent`) to appear when running with `--epic`. Also add the `ralph` label:

    ```bash
    bd create --title "Login form" --type task --parent beads-abc123 --label ralph
    bd create --title "Auth API" --type task --parent beads-abc123 --label ralph
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
    The `--parent` flag creates a parent-child relationship. Without it, tasks won't appear when filtering by epic.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dependencies (Optional)">
    If tasks depend on each other, add dependencies so Ralph works on them in the right order:

    ```bash
    # Login form depends on Auth API being done first
    bd dep add beads-login beads-api
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ralph TUI">
    Run with the epic ID:

    ```bash
    ralph-tui run --tracker beads --epic beads-abc123
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

Run with epic and tracker:

```bash
ralph-tui run --tracker beads --epic beads-abc123
```

### Config File

Set defaults in TOML:

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml
tracker = "beads"

[trackerOptions]
beadsDir = ".beads"
labels = "ralph"
```

### Options Reference

| Option       | Type   | Default  | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `beadsDir`   | string | `.beads` | Path to .beads directory                                     |
| `epicId`     | string | -        | Epic ID to filter tasks (set via `--epic` flag)              |
| `labels`     | string | `ralph`  | Comma-separated label filter (issues must have these labels) |
| `workingDir` | string | `.`      | Working directory for bd commands                            |

<Callout type="info">
  The `epicId` should be set via `--epic` flag rather than config, since you'll
  likely work on different epics.
</Callout>

## Beads Concepts

### Epics

Epics are top-level containers for related work:

```bash
# Create an epic
bd create --title "Feature: Dark Mode" --type epic

# List epics
bd list --type epic
```

### Tasks

Tasks are individual work items, optionally under an epic:

```bash
# Create standalone task
bd create --title "Fix login bug" --type task

# Create task under epic
bd create --title "Add toggle switch" --type task --parent beads-xyz
```

### Dependencies

Tasks can depend on (be blocked by) other tasks:

```bash
# Add dependency: task-b depends on task-a
bd dep add beads-task-b beads-task-a

# View dependencies
bd show beads-task-b
```

### Statuses

| Beads Status  | Ralph TUI Status | Description               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| `open`        | `open`           | Ready to work             |
| `in_progress` | `in_progress`    | Currently being worked on |
| `closed`      | `completed`      | Finished                  |
| `cancelled`   | `cancelled`      | Won't do                  |

### Priorities

Beads uses 0-4 priority scale (0 = critical):

| Priority | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 0        | Critical         |
| 1        | High             |
| 2        | Medium (default) |
| 3        | Low              |
| 4        | Backlog          |

## Task Selection

The Beads tracker selects the next task by:

1. Filter to tasks under the specified epic
2. Filter to tasks with status `open`
3. Filter to tasks with no unresolved dependencies
4. Sort by priority (lowest number first)
5. Return the first matching task

## Git Sync

Beads stores issues in `.beads/beads.jsonl`. Sync with your team:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
bd sync

# Or manually
git pull
```

Ralph TUI calls `bd sync` automatically when you run.

## Label Filtering

By default, Ralph TUI filters to issues with the `ralph` label. This lets you separate "Ralph-managed" work from other issues in the same beads repo.

### Adding Labels to Issues

```bash
# Add label when creating
bd create --title "My task" --type task --label ralph

# Add label to existing issue
bd label add beads-xyz ralph
```

### Changing the Label Filter

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml
[trackerOptions]
labels = "ralph,frontend"  # Multiple labels (comma-separated)
# labels = ""              # Empty = show all issues (no filter)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If no tasks appear, check that your issues have the `ralph` label (or whatever
  labels you configured).
</Callout>

## How It Works

When Ralph TUI runs with the Beads tracker:

1. **Detect**: Check for `.beads/` directory and `bd` CLI
2. **Query**: Run `bd list --json --parent <epic>` to get tasks
3. **Select**: Find next task (ready, highest priority)
4. **Update**: Set task to `in_progress` via `bd update`
5. **Execute**: Run agent with task prompt
6. **Complete**: Set task to `closed` via `bd update`
7. **Sync**: Run `bd sync` to push changes

### bd Commands Used

| Action        | Command                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| List tasks    | `bd list --json --parent <epic>`      |
| Get task      | `bd show <id> --json`                 |
| Start task    | `bd update <id> --status in_progress` |
| Complete task | `bd update <id> --status closed`      |
| Sync          | `bd sync`                             |

## Switching Epics

Change epics mid-session by pressing `l` in the TUI:

1. Press `l` to open epic selector
2. Choose from available epics
3. Task list updates to show new epic's tasks

Or restart with a different `--epic` flag.

## Troubleshooting

### "Beads directory not found"

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
bd init
```

### "bd binary not available"

Install the Beads CLI from the **[Beads GitHub repo](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)**.

### "No tasks available"

Check that:

1. **Tasks have the `ralph` label**: `bd list --label ralph` (or run `bd label add <task> ralph`)
2. **Tasks are children of the epic**: `bd list --parent <epic>` (create with `--parent <epic>`)
3. **Tasks are `open` status**: `bd list --status open`
4. **Dependencies are met**: `bd show <task-id>` (blocked tasks won't be selected)

### "Tasks not syncing"

Run sync manually:

```bash
bd sync
```

Check for git conflicts in `.beads/beads.jsonl`.

## Creating Tasks from PRDs

Convert a PRD to Beads issues:

```bash
# Create PRD
ralph-tui create-prd --chat

# When prompted, choose "Beads" format
# Or convert manually:
ralph-tui convert --to beads ./tasks/my-prd.md
```

## Beads vs JSON Tracker

| Feature            | JSON    | Beads     |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------- |
| Setup complexity   | Lowest  | Medium    |
| External tools     | None    | `bd` CLI  |
| Git sync           | Manual  | Automatic |
| Epic hierarchy     | No      | Yes       |
| Team collaboration | Limited | Full      |
| Offline support    | Full    | Full      |

Choose JSON for quick experiments, Beads for team projects.
