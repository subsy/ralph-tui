## Task Selection Issues

### "No tasks available"

This error occurs when Ralph TUI cannot find any tasks to execute.

<Callout type="warning">
Check your task source first - the cause differs depending on whether you're using prd.json or Beads.
</Callout>

**For prd.json users:**

- Verify your prd.json file exists and has the correct structure
- Check that tasks have `"passes": false` - completed tasks (`"passes": true`) are skipped
- Ensure tasks aren't blocked by incomplete dependencies

```bash
# View your prd.json structure
cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | {id, title, passes}'
```

**For Beads users:**

- Check that your epic has open tasks:
  ```bash
  bd list --epic your-epic-id
  ```
- Verify tasks aren't blocked by dependencies:
  ```bash
  bd ready
  ```
- Ensure the epic ID matches what you specified in `--epic`

### Tasks Stuck in "in_progress"

If Ralph TUI crashed or was forcefully terminated, tasks may remain stuck in the `in_progress` state.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Resume will automatically reset stale in_progress tasks
ralph-tui resume

# Or manually reset via Beads
bd update TASK-ID --status open

# For prd.json, edit the file directly
# Change "status": "in_progress" to "status": "pending"
```

### Wrong Task Being Selected

Ralph TUI selects tasks based on priority and dependency order. If an unexpected task is selected:

1. **Check dependencies**: Tasks with blockers are skipped
2. **Verify priorities**: Lower priority numbers are processed first
3. **For beads-bv**: PageRank and critical path analysis influence selection

```bash
# For Beads - view task dependencies
bd show TASK-ID

# For beads-bv - see graph analysis
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'
```

## Agent Issues

### "Agent not found"

Ralph TUI cannot locate your AI agent CLI executable.

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the agent is installed:
   ```bash
   which claude      # For Claude Code
   which opencode    # For OpenCode
   ```

2. Check your PATH includes the agent:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

3. See detected agents:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui plugins agents
   ```

4. Specify the agent explicitly:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui run --agent claude --prd ./prd.json
   ```

<Callout type="tip">
If you installed an agent with a different package manager (npm, cargo, pip), you may need to add its bin directory to your PATH.
</Callout>

### Agent Output Not Streaming

If you don't see real-time output from the agent:

1. **Check subagent tracing settings**: High filtering may hide output
   ```toml
   # In .ralph-tui/config.toml
   subagentTracingDetail = "full"  # Try "full" for maximum visibility
   ```

2. **Verify agent supports streaming**: Claude Code uses `--print` flag automatically

3. **Check terminal compatibility**: Some terminals may buffer output

  ]}

## Session Issues

### "Session lock exists"

Another Ralph TUI instance may be running, or a previous session didn't shut down cleanly.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for running processes:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep ralph-tui
   ```

2. **Wait for the existing session** to complete

3. **Force override the lock:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui resume --force
   ```

4. **Manually remove the lock file:**
   ```bash
   rm .ralph-tui-session.json
   ```

<Callout type="warning">
Force overriding or deleting the session file will lose any unsaved progress. Only do this if you're certain no other session is running.
</Callout>

### Session Won't Resume

If `ralph-tui resume` fails:

1. **Check session file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .ralph-tui-session.json
   ```

2. **Verify session file is valid JSON:**
   ```bash
   cat .ralph-tui-session.json | jq .
   ```

3. **Check for stale locks:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui status --json
   ```

4. **Start fresh if needed:**
   ```bash
   rm .ralph-tui-session.json
   ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
   ```

### Progress Lost After Crash

Ralph TUI saves progress after each iteration. If progress was lost:

1. **Check iteration logs** for completed work:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui logs --iteration 1
   ```

2. **Review the progress file:**
   ```bash
   cat .ralph-tui/progress.md
   ```

3. **For Beads**, task status is persisted immediately:
   ```bash
   bd list --status completed
   ```

## Rate Limiting

### Handling API Rate Limits

When using Claude Code or other API-based agents, you may hit rate limits during long sessions.

<Callout type="info">
Rate limiting is common with high-volume usage. Ralph TUI has built-in strategies to handle this gracefully.
</Callout>

**Configure rate limit handling:**

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml

[rateLimitHandling]
strategy = "wait"           # wait | fallback | abort
maxWaitTimeMs = 300000      # 5 minutes max wait
backoffMultiplier = 2       # Exponential backoff

# Optional: fallback to another agent
fallbackAgents = ["opencode"]
```

**Strategy options:**

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `wait` | Pause and retry with exponential backoff |
| `fallback` | Switch to a fallback agent |
| `abort` | Stop execution immediately |

**Reducing rate limit issues:**

1. **Use iteration delays:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui run --delay 5000 --prd ./prd.json
   ```

2. **Limit concurrent sessions** - Don't run multiple Ralph TUI instances simultaneously

3. **Consider using a lower-tier model** for less critical tasks:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui run --model haiku --prd ./prd.json
   ```

### Rate Limit with Beads Sync

If rate limits occur during Beads synchronization:

```bash
# Check sync status
bd sync --status

# Retry sync manually
bd sync
```

## Completion Detection Issues

### Task Not Marked Complete

Ralph TUI detects completion when the agent outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`. If tasks aren't being marked complete:

1. **Verify the agent outputs the token:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui logs --iteration 5 --verbose | grep -i "promise"
   ```

2. **Check your prompt template** includes completion instructions:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui template show
   ```

3. **Ensure the agent follows instructions** - The prompt template should clearly instruct the agent to output the completion token

### False Completion Detection

If tasks are marked complete prematurely:

1. **Review the iteration logs:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui logs --task US-005 --verbose
   ```

2. **Check for early completion tokens** in agent output

3. **Verify acceptance criteria** are being validated before completion

## Configuration Issues

### Config File Not Found

Ralph TUI looks for configuration in this order:
1. CLI flags
2. Project config: `.ralph-tui/config.toml`
3. Global config: `~/.config/ralph-tui/config.toml`

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Run setup to create config
ralph-tui setup

# Or view current effective config
ralph-tui config show
```

### Config Options Not Taking Effect

1. **Check config file syntax:**
   ```bash
   cat .ralph-tui/config.toml
   ```

2. **Verify TOML formatting** - TOML is sensitive to syntax

3. **CLI flags override config** - Check your command line options

4. **View merged configuration:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui config show
   ```
