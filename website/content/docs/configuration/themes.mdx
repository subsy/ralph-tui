## Custom Themes

Ralph TUI supports custom color themes via JSON files. Load a theme at runtime with the `--theme` option:

```bash
ralph-tui run --theme ./assets/themes/high-contrast-theme.json
```

## Bundled Themes

Two themes are included in `assets/themes/`:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bright-theme.json` | Vibrant colors with purple backgrounds |
| `high-contrast-theme.json` | High contrast with near-black backgrounds |

## Theme File Structure

Theme files define colors for different UI elements. See [`assets/themes/high-contrast-theme.json`](https://github.com/subsy/ralph-tui/blob/main/assets/themes/high-contrast-theme.json) for a complete example.

```json
{
  "bg": {
    "primary": "#0a0a0f",
    "secondary": "#12121a",
    "tertiary": "#1a1a24",
    "highlight": "#22222e"
  },
  "fg": {
    "primary": "#ffffff",
    "secondary": "#f0f0f0",
    "muted": "#b0b0c0",
    "dim": "#808090"
  },
  "status": {
    "success": "#00ff66",
    "warning": "#ffdd00",
    "error": "#ff4477",
    "info": "#44ddff"
  },
  "task": {
    "done": "#00ff66",
    "active": "#00ff66",
    "actionable": "#66ff00",
    "pending": "#9090a0",
    "blocked": "#ff4477",
    "error": "#ff2255",
    "closed": "#606070"
  },
  "accent": {
    "primary": "#44ddff",
    "secondary": "#ff44dd",
    "tertiary": "#ffff44"
  },
  "border": {
    "normal": "#3a3a4a",
    "active": "#44ddff",
    "muted": "#2a2a3a"
  }
}
```

## Color Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `bg` | Background colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, highlight) |
| `fg` | Foreground/text colors (primary, secondary, muted, dim) |
| `status` | Status indicator colors (success, warning, error, info) |
| `task` | Task state colors (done, active, actionable, pending, blocked, error, closed) |
| `accent` | Accent colors for highlights and emphasis |
| `border` | Border colors (normal, active, muted) |

## Partial Themes

You don't need to specify every color. Missing values fall back to the default Tokyo Night theme:

```json
{
  "bg": { "primary": "#000000" },
  "fg": { "primary": "#ffffff" }
}
```

This creates a theme that only overrides the primary background and foreground colors.

## Color Format

All colors must be valid hex color codes:

- 6-digit hex: `#ff0000` (red)
- 3-digit hex: `#f00` (red, shorthand)

<Callout type="warning">
Invalid hex colors will cause the theme to fail validation. Ralph TUI validates all colors at load time and reports any errors.
</Callout>

## Creating a Custom Theme

1. Copy an existing theme as a starting point:
   ```bash
   cp assets/themes/high-contrast-theme.json my-theme.json
   ```

2. Edit the colors to your preference

3. Load your theme:
   ```bash
   ralph-tui run --theme ./my-theme.json
   ```

<Callout type="tip">
Start with a partial theme if you only want to change a few colors. The default Tokyo Night theme provides sensible defaults for any colors you don't specify.
</Callout>
