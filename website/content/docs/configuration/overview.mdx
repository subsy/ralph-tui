## Configuration System

Ralph TUI uses a layered configuration system that allows you to set defaults at multiple levels. Each layer can override settings from the previous layer.

<Callout type="info">
Configuration files use TOML format, which is designed to be easy to read and write. All configuration is validated at runtime with helpful error messages.
</Callout>

## Configuration Layers

Settings are loaded in this order, with later layers overriding earlier ones:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Global Config">
    **Location:** `~/.config/ralph-tui/config.toml`

    User-wide defaults that apply to all projects. Great for setting your preferred agent or common options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Config">
    **Location:** `.ralph-tui/config.toml` (in project root)

    Project-specific settings that override global defaults. Created automatically by `ralph-tui setup`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="CLI Flags">
    Command-line options that override everything. Useful for one-off changes or scripting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Files

Both global and project configs use the same schema and TOML format:

```toml
# Example configuration
agent = "claude"
tracker = "beads-bv"
maxIterations = 10
iterationDelay = 1000
```

### File Locations

| Config Level | Path | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Global | `~/.config/ralph-tui/config.toml` | User-wide defaults |
| Project | `.ralph-tui/config.toml` | Project-specific settings |

<Callout type="tip">
The project config is searched up from your current directory, so you can run `ralph-tui` from any subdirectory and it will find the config in your project root.
</Callout>

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to create configuration is with the setup wizard:

```bash
ralph-tui setup
```

This interactive command will:
1. Detect installed agents (Claude Code, OpenCode)
2. Create `.ralph-tui/config.toml` with your choices
3. Install bundled skills for PRD creation
4. Optionally configure trackers

## Viewing Configuration

To see your merged configuration (global + project + defaults):

```bash
ralph-tui config show
```

This shows the effective configuration after all layers are merged, helpful for debugging.

## Configuration Sections

Ralph TUI configuration is organized into several sections:

### Core Settings

Basic execution parameters:

```toml
maxIterations = 10       # Maximum iterations (0 = unlimited)
iterationDelay = 1000    # Delay between iterations (ms)
outputDir = ".ralph-tui/iterations"
progressFile = ".ralph-tui/progress.md"
autoCommit = false       # Auto-commit after task completion
```

### Agent Settings

Configure which AI agent to use:

```toml
agent = "claude"         # Shorthand: use this agent plugin

# Or configure with options:
[agentOptions]
model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

### Tracker Settings

Configure your task source:

```toml
tracker = "beads-bv"     # Shorthand: use this tracker plugin

# Or configure with options:
[trackerOptions]
epicId = "beads-001"
```

### Error Handling

Control how Ralph responds to failures:

```toml
[errorHandling]
strategy = "skip"        # "retry", "skip", or "abort"
maxRetries = 3
retryDelayMs = 5000
```

### Rate Limiting

Configure fallback behavior for API rate limits:

```toml
fallbackAgents = ["opencode"]

[rateLimitHandling]
enabled = true
maxRetries = 3
baseBackoffMs = 5000
```
