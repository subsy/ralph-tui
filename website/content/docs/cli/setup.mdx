description: Run the interactive setup wizard to configure Ralph TUI for your project.
---

## Synopsis

```bash
ralph-tui setup
```

The `setup` command runs an interactive wizard that configures Ralph TUI for your project. It detects available agents, creates configuration files, and installs bundled skills.

<Callout type="tip">
Running `ralph-tui setup` is the recommended first step when starting with Ralph TUI in a new project.
</Callout>

## Aliases

```bash
ralph-tui init    # Same as setup
```

## What Setup Does

The interactive wizard performs these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect Installed Agents">
    Scans for available AI coding agents:
    - **Claude Code** - Looks for `claude` CLI
    - **OpenCode** - Looks for `opencode` CLI
    - **Factory Droid** - Looks for `droid` CLI

    Prompts you to select which agent to use as the default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Configuration">
    Creates `.ralph-tui/config.toml` with your selected options:
    - Default agent and tracker
    - Model preferences
    - Error handling strategy
    - Iteration limits
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Skills">
    Installs bundled skills for PRD creation and task conversion:
    - `ralph-tui-prd` - AI-powered PRD creation
    - `ralph-tui-create-json` - Convert PRD to prd.json
    - `ralph-tui-create-beads` - Convert PRD to Beads issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Existing Trackers">
    Optionally scans for existing task sources:
    - `prd.json` files
    - Beads configuration (`.beads/`)
    - Existing PRD markdown files
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

### Basic Setup

```bash
cd your-project
ralph-tui setup
```

Example interaction:

```
Welcome to Ralph TUI Setup!

Detecting installed agents...
✓ Found: claude (Claude Code)
✓ Found: opencode (OpenCode)
✓ Found: droid (Factory Droid)

? Which agent should be the default?
❯ claude - Claude Code (recommended)
  opencode - OpenCode
  droid - Factory Droid

? Default tracker type?
❯ json - Simple JSON file (no dependencies)
  beads - Git-backed issue tracker
  beads-bv - Beads with graph analysis

? Maximum iterations per session? (0 = unlimited)
❯ 10

Creating configuration...
✓ Created .ralph-tui/config.toml

Installing skills...
✓ Installed ralph-tui-prd
✓ Installed ralph-tui-create-json
✓ Installed ralph-tui-create-beads

Setup complete! Next steps:
1. Create a PRD: ralph-tui create-prd --chat
2. Start Ralph: ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
```

## Configuration Created

Setup creates `.ralph-tui/config.toml`:

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml (created by setup)

# Default tracker and agent
tracker = "json"
agent = "claude"

# Execution limits
maxIterations = 10

# Agent-specific options
[agentOptions]
model = "sonnet"

# Error handling
[errorHandling]
strategy = "skip"
maxRetries = 3
retryDelayMs = 5000
```

## Skills Installation

Skills are installed to your agent's skills directory:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ralph-tui-prd` | AI-powered PRD creation |
| `ralph-tui-create-json` | Convert PRD to JSON tasks |
| `ralph-tui-create-beads` | Convert PRD to Beads issues |

<Callout type="tip">
These skills can also be used **directly in your agent** without the Ralph TUI interface. See [Using Skills Directly](#using-skills-directly) below.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
You can manage skills manually with `ralph-tui skills list` and `ralph-tui skills install --force`.
</Callout>

## Skipping Setup

If you want to run Ralph without the interactive setup:

```bash
# Skip setup and use defaults
ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json --no-setup

# Or create config manually
mkdir -p .ralph-tui
cat > .ralph-tui/config.toml << 'EOF'
tracker = "json"
agent = "claude"
maxIterations = 10
EOF
```

## Re-running Setup

You can run setup again to update your configuration:

```bash
# Re-run setup (will ask before overwriting)
ralph-tui setup
```

<Callout type="warning">
Re-running setup will prompt before overwriting existing configuration. Your current settings will be shown as defaults.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### "No agents found"

Ensure you have at least one supported agent installed:

```bash
# Check for Claude Code
which claude

# Check for OpenCode
which opencode

# Check for Factory Droid
which droid

# If not found, install one:
# Claude Code: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
# OpenCode: https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode
# Factory Droid: https://docs.factory.ai/reference/cli-reference
```

### "Permission denied" for skills

Ensure the skills directory is writable:

```bash
# Check which directory skills are installed to
ralph-tui skills list

# Create skills directory if needed (for Claude Code)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
```

## Using Skills Directly

After running `ralph-tui setup`, the installed skills can be used **directly in your preferred AI agent** without needing the Ralph TUI interface. This is ideal when you want to:

- Reference files and use agent-native features during PRD creation
- Integrate PRD creation into your existing workflow
- Use the skills as part of a larger conversation with your agent

### Direct Skill Usage

Once skills are installed, invoke them with slash commands in your agent:

```bash
# In your agent, type:
/ralph-tui-prd         # Start creating a PRD interactively
/ralph-tui-create-json # Convert an existing PRD to prd.json
/ralph-tui-create-beads # Convert an existing PRD to Beads issues
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a PRD directly in your agent:**
   ```
   You: /ralph-tui-prd
   Agent: I'll help you create a PRD. What feature would you like to plan?
   You: I want to add user authentication. Here's our existing auth code: @src/auth/
   Agent: [Asks clarifying questions, references your code]
   ```

2. **Convert to tasks:**
   ```
   You: /ralph-tui-create-json
   Agent: I'll convert the PRD to prd.json format...
   ```

3. **Run Ralph for autonomous execution:**
   ```bash
   ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
   ```

### Why Use Skills Directly?

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `ralph-tui create-prd --chat` | Quick standalone PRD creation |
| `/ralph-tui-prd` in your agent | Complex PRDs that need file references, existing context, or iterative refinement |
| `ralph-tui run` | Autonomous task execution |

<Callout type="tip">
Using skills directly in your agent gives you full access to file references, conversation context, and all agent features while creating your PRD.
