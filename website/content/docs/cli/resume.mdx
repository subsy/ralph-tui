description: Resume an interrupted Ralph TUI session from where it left off.
---

## Synopsis

```bash
ralph-tui resume [options]
```

The `resume` command continues execution from a previously interrupted session. Ralph loads the saved session state and picks up where it left off, automatically resetting any stale "in_progress" tasks.

<Callout type="tip">
Session state is automatically saved to `.ralph-tui-session.json`. You can resume even after crashes or forced exits.
</Callout>

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--cwd <path>` | Working directory (where to find the session file) |
| `--headless` | Run without TUI |
| `--force` | Override stale lock (use if another instance crashed) |

## Examples

### Basic Resume

```bash
# Resume from current directory
ralph-tui resume

# Resume headless for CI pipelines
ralph-tui resume --headless
```

### Resume from Different Directory

```bash
# Resume a session in another project
ralph-tui resume --cwd /path/to/project
```

### Force Override Stale Lock

```bash
# Override if previous instance crashed
ralph-tui resume --force
```

<Callout type="warning">
Only use `--force` when you're certain no other Ralph instance is running. Using it while another instance is active can cause conflicts.
</Callout>

## What Gets Restored

When you resume a session, Ralph restores:

- **Iteration number** - Continues counting from where you left off
- **Task statuses** - Completed tasks remain completed
- **Progress file** - Cross-iteration context is preserved
- **Configuration** - Uses the same config as the original run

## Handling Stale Tasks

If Ralph was interrupted while a task was "in_progress", resume automatically:

1. Detects tasks stuck in "in_progress" state
2. Resets them to "open" status
3. Re-selects the next task based on priority

This ensures no tasks are permanently stuck due to crashes.

## Session Lock

Ralph uses a lock mechanism to prevent multiple instances:

- The session file includes a lock timestamp
- If the lock is stale (older than a threshold), resume can proceed
- Use `--force` to override the lock if needed

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Execution">
    ```bash
    ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
    ```
    Ralph begins processing tasks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interrupt">
    Press `q` to quit, or the process gets interrupted.
    Session state is saved automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resume Later">
    ```bash
    ralph-tui resume
    ```
    Ralph continues from where it left off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### "Session lock exists"

Another Ralph instance may be running, or a previous instance crashed:

```bash
# Check if another instance is running
ps aux | grep ralph-tui

# If not, force resume
ralph-tui resume --force
```

### "No session found"

No `.ralph-tui-session.json` file exists in the working directory:

```bash
# Start a new session instead
ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
```

### "Task stuck in_progress"

Resume handles this automatically, but you can also manually reset:

```bash
# For beads tracker
bd update TASK-ID --status open

# For JSON tracker, edit prd.json directly
```
