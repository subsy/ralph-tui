## 2-Minute Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is with **JSON mode** - no external dependencies required! You'll have Ralph TUI running autonomously in just a few steps.

<Callout type="tip">
JSON mode uses a simple `prd.json` file for task tracking. It's perfect for getting started quickly without setting up external tools.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Ralph TUI">
    Install Ralph TUI globally using bun:

    ```bash
    bun install -g ralph-tui
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
    Ralph TUI requires Bun as its runtime. If you don't have Bun installed, see the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Your Project">
    Navigate to your project and run the setup wizard:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ralph-tui setup
    ```

    The interactive wizard will:
    - Detect installed agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Factory Droid)
    - Create a `.ralph-tui/config.toml` configuration file
    - Install bundled skills for PRD creation and task conversion
    - Optionally detect existing trackers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a PRD">
    Use the AI-powered PRD creator to define your feature:

    ```bash
    ralph-tui create-prd --chat
    ```

    The AI will ask about your feature goals and requirements, then generate:
    - A PRD markdown file (`./tasks/prd-<feature>.md`)
    - A task file (`./prd.json`) ready for execution

    <Callout type="tip">
    Answer the AI's questions about your feature. When done, you'll be prompted to create tasks automatically.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ralph">
    Start the autonomous execution loop:

    ```bash
    ralph-tui run --prd ./prd.json
    ```

    Ralph will now:
    - Select the highest-priority task with no blockers
    - Build a prompt from the task details
    - Execute your AI agent
    - Stream output in real-time
    - Detect completion and move to the next task
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

Let's break down what each step accomplished:

1. **Setup** configured Ralph and installed the `ralph-tui-prd` skill for AI-powered PRD creation
2. **Create-prd** had an AI conversation about your feature and created structured tasks
3. **Run** started the autonomous loop - Ralph picks tasks, builds prompts, runs your agent, and marks tasks complete

## Alternative: With Beads Tracker

If you use [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking, you can run Ralph with an epic:

```bash
# Run with a beads epic
ralph-tui run --epic my-project-epic
```

Beads provides additional features like:
- Git-backed persistence
- Task dependencies
- Hierarchy (epics containing stories)
- Labels and priorities

## Alternative: Using Skills Directly in Your Agent

Prefer to stay in your agent's native interface? After running `ralph-tui setup`, you can use the installed skills directly:

```bash
# Use slash commands in your agent:
/ralph-tui-prd           # Create a PRD interactively
/ralph-tui-create-json   # Convert PRD to prd.json
/ralph-tui-create-beads  # Convert PRD to Beads issues
```

This approach lets you:
- Reference files with `@filename` during PRD creation
- Use your existing conversation context
- Keep your preferred agent interface

<Callout type="tip">
**Recommended hybrid workflow:** Create your PRD using `/ralph-tui-prd` in your agent where you can reference source files, then use `ralph-tui run` for autonomous task execution.
</Callout>

## Controlling Execution

While Ralph is running, use these keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Start execution |
| `p` | Pause/Resume execution |
| `+` / `=` | Add 10 iterations (extends max iterations) |
| `-` / `_` | Remove 10 iterations (minimum of current iteration or 1) |
| `d` | Toggle progress dashboard |
| `o` | Cycle right panel views (details → output → prompt) |
| `O` | Jump directly to prompt preview |
| `h` | Toggle show/hide closed tasks |
| `r` | Refresh task list from tracker |
| `q` | Quit |
| `?` | Show all shortcuts |

## Understanding the TUI

The terminal interface shows:

- **Left Panel**: Task list with status indicators (✓ complete, ▶ active, ○ pending, ⊘ blocked)
- **Right Panel**: Details view with three modes:
  - **Details**: Task metadata (title, description, dependencies)
  - **Output**: Live agent stdout/stderr
  - **Prompt**: Preview of the rendered prompt being sent to the agent
- **Header**: Current iteration count (e.g., `[3/10]`) and active task
- **Footer**: Available keyboard shortcuts

<Callout type="tip">
Use `O` to preview the exact prompt being sent to your AI agent. This is helpful for debugging templates or understanding what context the agent receives.
</Callout>
