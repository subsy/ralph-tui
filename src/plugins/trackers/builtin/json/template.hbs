We are working in a project to implement the following Product Requirements Document (PRD):

{{prdContent}}

{{/if}}

{{!-- Task details --}}
## Your Task: {{taskId}} - {{taskTitle}}

{{#if taskDescription}}
### Description
{{taskDescription}}
{{/if}}

{{#if acceptanceCriteria}}
### Acceptance Criteria
{{acceptanceCriteria}}
{{/if}}

{{#if notes}}
### Notes

{{/if}}

{{#if dependsOn}}
**Prerequisites**: {{dependsOn}}
{{/if}}

{{#if recentProgress}}
## Recent Progress
{{recentProgress}}
{{/if}}

## Workflow
1. Study the PRD context above to understand the bigger picture
2. Study `.ralph-tui/progress.md` to understand overall status, implementation progress, and learnings including codebase patterns and gotchas
3. Implement this single story following acceptance criteria
4. Run quality checks: typecheck, lint, etc.
5. Commit with message: `feat: {{taskId}} - {{taskTitle}}`
6. Document learnings (see below)
7. Signal completion

## Before Completing
APPEND to `.ralph-tui/progress.md`:
```
## [Date] - {{taskId}}
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
---
```

If you discovered a **reusable pattern**, also add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.md.

## Stop Condition
**IMPORTANT**: If the work is already complete (implemented in a previous iteration or already exists), verify it meets the acceptance criteria and signal completion immediately.

When finished (or if already complete), signal completion with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
