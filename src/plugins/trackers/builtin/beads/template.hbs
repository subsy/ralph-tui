  We are working in a project to implement the following Product Requirements
  Document (PRD):

  {{prdContent}}

  ---
{{/if}}

## Bead Details - **ID**:
{{taskId}}
- **Title**:
{{taskTitle}}
{{#if epicId}}
  - **Epic**:
  {{epicId}}{{#if epicTitle}} - {{epicTitle}}{{/if}}
{{/if}}
{{#if taskDescription}}
  - **Description**:
  {{taskDescription}}
{{/if}}

{{#if acceptanceCriteria}}
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  {{acceptanceCriteria}}
{{/if}}

{{#if dependsOn}}
  **Prerequisites**:
  {{dependsOn}}
{{/if}}

{{#if recentProgress}}
  ## Recent Progress
  {{recentProgress}}
{{/if}}

## Workflow 1. Study the PRD context above to understand the bigger picture (if
available) 2. Study `.ralph-tui/progress.md` to understand overall status,
implementation progress, and learnings including codebase patterns and gotchas
3. Implement the requirements (stay on current branch) 4. Run your project's
quality checks (typecheck, lint, etc.) 5. Commit: `feat:
{{taskId}}
-
{{taskTitle}}` 6. Close the bead: `bd close
{{taskId}}
--db
{{beadsDbPath}}
--reason "Brief description"` 7. Document learnings (see below) 8. Signal
completion ## Before Completing APPEND to `.ralph-tui/progress.md`: ``` ##
[Date] -
{{taskId}}
- What was implemented - Files changed - **Learnings:** - Patterns discovered -
Gotchas encountered --- ``` If you discovered a **reusable pattern**, also add
it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.md. ## Stop
Condition **IMPORTANT**: If the work is already complete (implemented in a
previous iteration or already exists), verify it works correctly and signal
completion immediately. When finished (or if already complete), signal
completion with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
